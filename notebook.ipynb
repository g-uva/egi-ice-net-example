    "# Sea ice forecasting using the IceNet library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the [IceNet library](https://pypi.org/project/icenet/) for sea-ice forecasting trained using climate reanalysis and observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "[IceNet](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet/) is a python library that provides the ability to download, process, train and predict from end to end. Users can interact with IceNet either via the python interface or via a set of command-line interfaces (CLI) which provide a high-level interface that covers the above abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the python library api for forecasting sea ice for a reduced dataset to demonstrate its capabilities. The final output of interest are maps of sea ice concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling approach\n",
    "IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system. It utilises ensemble modelling of [U-Net](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28) networks to generate daily forecasts of sea ice condition, trained on climate reanalysis and sea ice observational data (the built-in downloaders within IceNet are extensible). The original IceNet research model, published in Nature Communications ([Seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasting with probabilistic deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4)) was trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python library ([IceNet](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet/)) showcased in this notebook is a heavily refactored version of the original research code from the original publication that has been developed for operational forecasting that utilises daily inputs and is able to generate daily forecast outputs for a variable forecast time period. The core U-Net architecture is implemented using Tensorflow, however, the library architecture allows other backend libraries to be utilised and wrapped around the IceNet library ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    " * [1. Setup](#-1.-Setup) the environment and project structure.\n",
    " * [2. Download](#-2.-Download) sea ice concentration data as training data.\n",
    " * [3. Process](#-3.-Process) downloaded data, and generate cached datasets to speed up training.\n",
    " * [4. Train](#-4.-Train) the neural network and generate checkpoint and model output.\n",
    " * [5. Predict](#-5.-Predict) for defined dates.\n",
    " * [6. Visualisation](#-6.-Visualisation) of the prediction output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compatible platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IceNet` library is designed to be run within a Unix environment, and, as such, this notebook has been tested on the following OS platforms:\n",
    "* Linux\n",
    "* macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows: although [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) should work, but it is untested, and is not a supported platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of hardware, this notebook (and IceNet in general) does not require a GPU, however, when attempting a larger training run, the use of a GPU is highly recommended.\n",

    "This library supports sea ice forecasting on a daily resolution rather than monthly-averaged. It has been developed significantly since the original paper to operationalise the code, and to that end, there are multiple ways of interacting with the library to help enable development of sea ice forecasting and facilitate model development.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the use of the IceNet library to programmatically generate sea-ice forecasts via the `IceNet` python interface, across all stages of a machine learning workflow, from source data download to forecast visualisation. It demonstrated this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Showing usage of the IceNet library to download different climate data variables ([ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)) and sea ice concentration maps ([OSI SAF](https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/)) from different data sources via a similar api interface. (The ERA5 code was shown, but not run due to need for a free personal API key having been setup by the user)\n",
    "* Processing of downloaded data to include normalisation and data caching to speed up the training.\n",
    "* Showing the use of a high-level interface to the IceNet U-Net model to train on different data sources and generate predictions of binary sea ice concentration.\n",
    "* Visualising the predictions using the plotting tools within the IceNet library.\n",
    "* Visualising good results with increased network size and runtime.\n",
    "* If researching, consider [extending the functionality of the API to include revised or completely new implementations, such as additional data sources](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/05.library_extension.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training model generated, the accuracy of the results depends on the data used as training inputs (in this demonstrator notebook, only a limited subset of the OSI SAF SIC data is used due to resource limitations on Binder).\n",
    "\n",
    "On less resource constricted systems, as elucidated above, it is possible to use other data downloaders that include variables which relate to sea ice formation to improve prediction results while including a larger date range as available from the different data sources. For day to day forecast generation, a subset of the OSI SAF (1940-present) and ERA5 datasets (1979-present) are utilised for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, the [original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4) is a recommended read. A more up-to-date paper considering the latest IceNet implementation changes since the publication of the original paper is currently in progress."

There are also command line interface and bash scripts that allow operationalising IceNet and simplify the typical workflows one might come across when generating sea ice forecasts.\n",

    "To learn more about such approaches, there are a series of introductory notebooks (five notebooks at present) that cover both the fundamental and advanced usage scenarios of the IceNet library under the [icenet-notebooks](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks) repository. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Introductory usage via CLI](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/01.cli_demonstration.ipynb): Demonstrates the usage of the different stages of icenet (download, process, train, predict and output) via a very high level command line interface.\n",
    "* [Pipeline usage](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/02.pipeline_demonstration.ipynb): Creating operational and reproducible end-to-end runs.\n",
    "* [Data structure and analysis](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/03.data_and_forecasts.ipynb): Understand the structure of the data stores and products created by these workflows and what tools currently exist in IceNet to look over them.\n",
    "* [Library usage](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/04.library_usage.ipynb): Understand how to programmatically perform an end to end run.\n",
    "* [Library extension](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/blob/main/05.library_extension.ipynb): Understand why and how to extend the IceNet library."
